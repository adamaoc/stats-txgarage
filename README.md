# txGarage Stats

This is the web stack running the stats.txgarage.com app.

### tech:

`PHP`, `Gulp`, `JavaScript`, `Sass`

### Build:

Run `npm install` in the root directory to get all the dependencies.

Run `gulp sass` to build the css

Run `gulp scripts` to build the js

Run `gulp` to build both and have it watching the files

### Running

At the moment `PHP` isn't necessary for the project but we may use it in the future.
You still must run a `php server` to see the page.

```
php -S localhost:8888

// navigate to http://localhost:8888
```
